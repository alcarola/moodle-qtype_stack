STACK questions form part of the Moodle quiz.  You may form quizzes with a mix of STACK questions and other Moodle question types.

**STACK is designed primarity to be used with Adaptive mode**.  This is set under _Question behaviour_.

Please consult the [moodle documentation](http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/Quiz_module) for details of how to create and use Moodle quizzes.
