# Reviewing

Computer aided assessment of mathematics works in the following phases.

1. [Authoring](../Authoring/index.md),
2. [Testing](Testing.md) and
3. [Deploying](Deploying.md) questions.
4. [Adding questions to a quiz](Quiz.md) and use by students.
5. [Reviewing](Reviewing.md) and statistical analysis.

Reviewing students' answers closes the learning cycle for teachers by allowing them to understand what students are doing. Basic reviewing is undertaken through the Moodle quiz.  For example, lists of scores etc. are available there.  The Moodle quiz also calculates basic statistics based on the numerical information.

**NOTE** most of the STACK specific review features are not yet implemented in STACK 3.

To review work we need to use two important parts of the question. Please read the following two entries before continuing with this article.

* The [question note](Question_note.md).
* The [answer note](Potential_response_trees.md#Answer_note).

## Individual item analysis ##

_NOT YET IMPLEMENTED_

* Analysis of item as a whole, e.g. combine all the answer notes from each deployed version.
* Analysis of different versions.  Differences in frequencies of answer notes?
* List of invalid answers.
