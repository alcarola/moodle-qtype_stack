We will maintain this page to indicate which languages are being worked on or have been requested.

Details of who translated STACK are given under [credits](../About/Credits.md).

# How to translate STACK

STACK is part of Moodle.  Hence, we have used the Moodle translation management system.  _ALL_ strings which appear to the user should be found in the single file

    /stack/lang/en/qtype_stack.php

To translate STACK into another language create the appropriate directory using the two letter country code.  Copy the above file into this directory and edit it.  This file contains the majority of strings seen by users.  However, remember to translate the other components of STACK, e.g. `qformat_stack` and also the question behaviours.  See the installation instructions for a full list.

Please send your translations to Chris Sangwin for inclusion into the distribution.

# Multilingual materials

Colleagues have asked for multilingual materials.  We plan to implement this using Moodle's Multi-language content filter, see
[http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Multi-language_content_filter](http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Multi-language_content_filter).
